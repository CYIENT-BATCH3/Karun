ALGORITHM:
1.start
2.program to monitor the bit.
3.in main declare the variable as i.
4.taking for loop to increment the value from 1-10.
5.if condition to check for 0th bit weather it is 1 or 0.
6.if value is '1' flag is set else flag is not set.
7.stop.
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
	setbuf(stdout,NULL);			//for compailer
	int i =0;
	for(i=0;i<=10;i++)				//loop increment from 0 to 10
	{
		if(i & 0x01)				//check for 0th bit weather it is 1 or 0
			printf("\n%d = flag is set",i);			//if it is 1 print flag is set
		else
			printf("\n%d = flag is not set",i);		//else print flag is not set
