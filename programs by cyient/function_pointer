//WAP using function pointer (i)add function (ii)sub function
ALGORITHM:
1.start
2.declare the function as result which passes the address as an argument to other function.
3.declare the add and sub functions
4.in main function result is called which we pass the address of add and sub.
5.when result function is called, which we pass the address of add and sub..
6.inside the result function call the add and sub function by dereferncing the pointer fptr and fptr2 contains address of add and sub.
7.now it will print the addition and subtraction.
8.stop.

#include <stdio.h>

int result( int(*fptr)(int, int), int (*fptr2) (int, int));//declaring the function as result which passes the address as an argument to other function.
int add(int, int);                                      //declaring the function as add with two arguments
int sub(int, int);                                      //declaring sub as function with two arguments

int main()
{
    result(add,sub);                                    //called which we pass the address of add and sub
    
}
int result( int(*fptr)(int , int), int (*fptr2) (int, int))// which we pass the address of add and sub.
{
    
    fptr(10,20);                                            //called to add
    fptr2(8,5);                                             //called to sub
}

int add(int a, int b)                                       //defining function for add
{
    int sum;
    sum = a+b;
    printf("sum = %d\n", sum);
    
}

int sub(int a, int b)
{
    int sub;
    sub = a-b;
